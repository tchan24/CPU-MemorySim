# CPU-MemorySim
### CS 4348 Operating System Project 1

The project will simulate a simple computer system consisting of a CPU and Memory.
The CPU and Memory will be simulated by separate processes that communicate.
Memory will contain one program that the CPU will execute and then the simulation will end.

javac CPU.java Memory.java
java CPU.java *.txt xxx

g++ Memory.cpp -o proj
